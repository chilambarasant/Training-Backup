        "detail":"There is no lack of unsavoury words to describe the state of public toilets in Delhi: Unhygienic, unsanitary or plain dirty. A common sight at most of these public washrooms is women entering with their noses and mouths covered. Even as the Swachh Bharat Mission was initiated in 2014 in a bid to free India from open defecation, there seems to have been no headway in the quality of options for citizens to use instead.",
